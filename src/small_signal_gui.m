function varargout = small_signal_gui(varargin)
% SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI MATLAB code for small_signal_gui.fig
%      SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI, by itself, creates a new SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI returns the handle to a new SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI('Property','Value',...) creates a new SMALL_SIGNAL_GUI or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before small_signal_gui_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to small_signal_gui_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
